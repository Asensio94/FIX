Notes:

Please note that the IP of the system may change from time to time. Therefore, it is important that the DNS provided is used instead of the IP,
to ensure that connectivity can be established at all times, transparent of any IP changes.

The DNS will always point to an IP address from the ranges 176.124.191.16/28 or 176.124.191.32/28. Therefore, if you are allowing out-going 
connections based on IP filters, please make sure that the specified ranges are allowed, and not just a single IP.

In case the specified main DNS (tradeslideuk.primexm.com) is not available, the following backup DNS can be used instead: tradeslideuk.primexm.net
